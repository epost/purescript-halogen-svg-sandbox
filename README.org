#+title:Halogen Sandbox

* Problem with SVG ~animateMotion~

** Description:

I generate some SVG containing a horizontal grey line. Upon pressing the
~animate~ button, the ball should start moving along the line from left to
right. Unfortunately, it doesn't. :(

However, when I copy the SVG into another div, and press the button again, the
animation /does/ start there.

It seems like there is something going on around Halogen that prevents the SVG
animation from working, but I have no clue what or how to diagnose it, other
than looking at possibly problematic event handlers in the browser dev tools,
which has been inconclusive.

** To reproduce:

1) ~npm install~
1) ~npm run build~
1) Open ~dist/index.html~ with your browser.
1) Follow instructions on the web page.

** Some details

- I tested this on Chrome and Firefox on Mac.
- The SVG code is adapted from https://github.com/kettlebell/purescript-halogen-svg, which is a fork of https://github.com/kwohlfahrt/purescript-halogen-svg.
